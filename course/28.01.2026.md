## Review last Session
In the last session we:
- set up your Git environment, which you need to make and save changes in your code
- created a new SSH key to authenticate with GitHub
- had a first look at the current state of the blog
- had a brief peek into the code structure
- forked your own version of the project
- made a first change and committed + pushed it to GitHub

## Feedback & Where do you want to go with this
**We're interested in some feedback for the last session:** 
- How was the pace? 
- How detailed should we explain things? 
- Everyone happy so far?<br>

**Where do you want to go with this course?** 
- Do you already have some ideas of what kind of blog or portfolio you want to create?

## Let's publish your website
We'll use **Vercel** to deploy your blog and make it accessible online.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new account at https://vercel.com (you can use your existing GitHub account and link it, this way Vercel will have access to all your projects)
2. Go to the overview page and click **"Add new"** → **"Project"**
3. Select your repository from the list and click **Import**
4. Give it a fitting project name (this will become your URL: `yourproject.vercel.app`)
5. Vercel is already quite good at detecting the settings you need, most of the time your projects can be deployed without any configuration changes
6. Click **Deploy**

Give it a minute or two. You'll now have a link to your published, online version of your blog.

## Project overview

### Core files
- **index.html** — defines the structure of your webpage
- **styles.css** — handles the visual appearance (colors, spacing, layout)
- **script.js** — controls the behavior and loads your content dynamically

### Folder structure
- **assets/** — place images and other media here
- **content/** — all your blog content lives here (text files, images, etc.)
- **modules/render/** — contains the rendering logic that displays your content

### How it works
The render module fetches your content files and displays them on the page. The `generate-file-array.sh` script scans your `/content` folder and creates a list of all files with their metadata (creation date, type, location). This way the JavaScript knows what content exists and can load it in the correct order.

## Let's add some content
Your content lives inside `/content`. You have two options:

**Option 1: Grouped content**  
Create folders to organize your content thematically:
```
content/
  firstTopic/
    test.txt
  secondTopic/
    image.jpg
```

**Option 2: Ungrouped content**  
Place files directly in `/content` without folders. They'll be displayed individually.

**Important:** After adding new content, you need to run:
```bash
./src/generate-file-array.sh
```
This tells the JavaScript where your content is located, when it was created, and what type it is. The blog displays newest content at the top.

## Quick CSS intro
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines how your HTML elements look.

**Basic syntax:**
```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

**Example:**
```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 32px;
}
```

**Common properties:**
- `color` — text color
- `background-color` — background color
- `font-size` — size of text
- `margin` — space outside elements
- `padding` — space inside elements

You can edit `styles.css` to change the appearance of your blog.
